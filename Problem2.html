                <h2>My Experience with Baking Macarons</h2>
            </header>
            <section>
                <p> Undertaking the mere act of attempting to bake macarons is a 
                    virtue. It is not for the faint of heart. It is definitely not 
                    where an amateur baker should attempt to foray. They are not 
                    even one of the most delicious desserts. So what would possess
                    anyone in their right mind to make them?</p>
                <p> For me, it's about the feeling of accomplishment rather than
                    the end product, which is antithetical to the tenets of baking.
                    To say that I mastered macarons is a badge of honor I wear
                    proudly.

                <h2>Ingredients for Macarons</h2>

            <section>
                <h3>Basic Ingredients</h3>
                <p>The ingredient list is short and simple which is a kind gesture
                    considering how complex they are to bake. Macarons require
                    almond flour, egg whites, powdered sugar, and granulated sugar.
                    Optional ingredients would be food coloring and any flavoring agents like
                    cocoa powder.

                <h3>Filling Ingredients</h3>
                <p> This is where the bulk of flavor comes from. The cookies are more
                    difficult to imbue with flavor than the filling. The filling 
                    is very versatile and can be made with a variety of ingredients.
                    You can use buttercreams, ganache, jams, or curds.

                <h3>Making the Shell</h3>
                <p> Making the cookie batter can be divided into predominantly two
                    steps: making the meringue and the macaronage process. A strong
                    meringue is the foundation to your cookie and sets the precedent
                    to your cookie's height, presence of feet, and fullness. Paradoxically,
                    once you build the meringue, you will enter the macaronage process
                    where you deflate all of that air you just whipped in.  </p>

            <h4>Did You Know?</h4>
            <p>The macaron is completely separate from the coconut macaroon but 
                easily confused if one pronounces them identically. </p>
